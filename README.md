##Detect AdBlocker
-------------------

#UPDATE

I am also using custom js along with FUCKADBLOCK js library as a fallback for detecting blockers like UBlock Origin.

We are using FUCKADBLOCK javascript library to detect if browser has AdBlocker plugins enabled. If its enabled then how to how to request your website visitors not to block ads and increase your Ads Revenue. 

Feel free to use modify and share.
